# NovelAI `.story` Import — Design

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Author:** chase (via brainstorm)
**Scope:** Add wholesale import of NovelAI `.story` files into Scriptr, producing either a new story (title + tags + Bible + chapters) or new chapters appended to an existing story. Also introduces a user-authored `////` split marker honored by both the new `.story` importer and the existing paste-based chapter importer.

## Motivation

The user is actively writing in NovelAI alongside Scriptr. NovelAI's native export format is `.story` — a JSON envelope wrapping a base64-encoded MessagePack CRDT document. Getting that content into Scriptr today would mean manually copy-pasting prose and re-entering character/lore notes. Wholesale import removes that friction and makes Scriptr a viable downstream editor/publisher for NovelAI sessions.

## Non-goals

- Round-trip export (Scriptr → `.story`). One-way import only.
- Preserving NovelAI-specific settings (phrase bias, banned sequences, ephemeral context, user scripts, per-entry `contextConfig`, trigger keyword activation). These have no Scriptr analog and are silently dropped.
- Interpreting the CRDT `history` for time-travel / undo semantics. We take the current rendered state and drop history.
- Importing `.story` files with a `storyContainerVersion` other than `1`. If NovelAI ships a v2, we'll extend then.
- Mid-import editing of Bible fields. Proposed Bible is shown read-only; user edits in the regular Bible editor post-import.

## User-facing surface

Two entry points, each with its own dialog:

1. **Stories list page** ([app/page.tsx](../../../app/page.tsx)) — button "Import from NovelAI". Creates a new story from the file: title, description, tags, lorebook → Bible, prose → chapters.
2. **Story editor page** ([app/s/[slug]/page.tsx](../../../app/s/[slug]/page.tsx)) — menu item "Import chapters from .story". Appends the file's AI prose as new chapters on the current story. File's Bible/tags are ignored (with an on-screen note explaining that).

Both dialogs let the user edit chapter titles, body text, delete unwanted chapters, and merge a chapter into the next one before committing. No drag-reorder in v1 (YAGNI).

## Prose extraction decisions

NovelAI stores user prompts and AI output as separate ordered sections inside the CRDT document, each with a `source` field (1 = user-typed prompt, 2 = AI output, based on observed pattern in the sample file). Per Q1 during brainstorming:

- **Only AI output (source=2) is imported as chapter prose.** User-typed prompts like *"Begin with Chapter 1: 'The Measurement.'"* are dropped. This produces the cleanest prose; users who want prompts preserved can copy them manually.

## Chapter splitting — priority order

Per Q3 during brainstorming (user-confirmed Approach C: preview & assign with heuristic splits). First match wins:

1. **`////` marker** — any line matching `^\s*\/{4,}\s*$` is consumed and used as a split point. User authors this in NovelAI before exporting. This is the explicit, highest-confidence signal.
2. **Chapter headings** — regex `^\s*chapter\s+([ivxlcdm\d]+)(?:\s*[:\-—]\s*(.+))?\s*$` (case-insensitive). The match line becomes the split; any captured title (e.g., `"The Measurement"` from `"Chapter 1: The Measurement"`) pre-fills the chapter title.
3. **Horizontal rules (fallback)** — `^\s*[\*\-_]{3,}\s*$` with 3+ occurrences and no `////` / headings present. Weak signal; UI flags as `"scene breaks (verify)"`.
4. **No split** — single chapter.

The `////` marker is **also** added to [lib/publish/cleanup.ts](../../../lib/publish/cleanup.ts)'s `splitChapterChunks`, alongside the existing `=== CHAPTER ===` marker, so the authoring convention is portable across the paste importer too. Both markers trigger the same boundary logic.

Title inference for chapters without an explicit heading: first non-empty sentence, truncated to 60 chars, trailing punctuation stripped.

## Bible mapping

Per Q4 (Approach A: auto-map, user edits in Bible editor after import):

- **Premise** ← `metadata.description` if non-empty, else `metadata.textPreview`.
- **People / Places** ← `content.lorebook.entries[]` partitioned by:
  - `entry.category` name match against `/person|character|people/i` → People; `/place|location|setting/i` → Places.
  - No category → pronoun sniff (`he |she |they |his |her |their ` in first sentence) → People; location-cue sniff (`is a` + noun like `city|town|village|room|house|building|campus|dorm|forest`) → Places.
  - Default fallback: People.
  - `name` ← `entry.displayName` or first key in `entry.keys`; `description` ← `entry.text`.
- **Notes** ← `content.context[].text` entries joined with `\n\n---\n\n` separator. This captures Memory + Author's Note verbatim without attempting to classify character sheets, canon rules, or style notes. User re-organizes in the Bible editor after import.
- **Tags** ← `metadata.tags` written to `story.tags` (not Bible).

**Silently dropped:** `metadata.favorite`, `lorebook.{categories,order,settings}`, per-entry `contextConfig`, `ephemeralContext`, `phraseBiasGroups`, `bannedSequenceGroups`, `messageSettings`, `sideChats`, `userScripts`, `scriptStorage`, `contextDefaults`, `settingsDirty`, `didGenerate`, `isModified`, `hasDocument`, `isTA`.

## Architecture

```
UI:
  app/page.tsx (stories list)   ──▶  NewStoryFromNovelAIDialog
  app/s/[slug]/page.tsx         ──▶  AddChaptersFromNovelAIDialog

Both dialogs call the same server endpoints:
  POST /api/import/novelai/parse    — parses .story file, returns preview
  POST /api/import/novelai/commit   — writes story/chapters/bible to disk

Server:
  lib/novelai/
    decode.ts    — base64 + msgpack decode, tree walk, source filter
    split.ts     — //// marker, heading heuristics, chapter chunks
    map.ts       — context/lorebook → Bible fields
    types.ts     — ParsedStory, ProposedChapter, ProposedBible, SplitResult
  lib/publish/cleanup.ts (existing)
                 — extend splitChapterChunks to recognize //// as well
```

Additive only: no changes to existing routes, storage helpers, or `ImportChapterDialog`. Storage writes go through the helpers in [lib/storage/](../../../lib/storage/) — no hand-rolled paths.

## Parse pipeline (`lib/novelai/decode.ts`)

Input: `Buffer` of uploaded `.story` bytes.
Output:

```ts
type ParsedStory = {
  title: string;               // metadata.title
  description: string;         // metadata.description
  tags: string[];              // metadata.tags
  textPreview: string;         // metadata.textPreview
  contextBlocks: string[];     // content.context[].text
  lorebookEntries: Array<{
    displayName: string;
    text: string;
    keys: string[];
    category?: string;
  }>;
  prose: string;               // AI output, joined in document order
};
```

Steps:

1. `JSON.parse` outer envelope; reject unless `storyContainerVersion === 1`.
2. Read `metadata`, `content.context`, `content.lorebook` directly (plain JSON).
3. Base64-decode `content.document` to bytes.
4. Feed bytes to `@msgpack/msgpack` Decoder configured with:
   - `extensionCodec` wrapping unknown ext codes as opaque `{kind:"ext", code, data}` (we don't need to interpret NovelAI's CRDT op markers).
5. Decoded stream is multiple top-level objects. Shape: `[extMarker, extMarker, keyTable, sectionsMap, ...history]`. Keep `keyTable` and `sectionsMap`; discard the rest.
6. **Extract prose in order:** walk `sectionsMap`, collect entries of shape `{type:"text", source:2, text:string}` (schema indices resolved via `keyTable`). Order by position in `content.document`'s `order` list when present; fall back to document order otherwise.
7. Trim section boundary noise (leading space, stray newlines); preserve internal paragraph breaks.
8. Join prose with `\n\n`.

Key-table resolution: the first array in the decoded stream is a key schema like `["sections", "order", "history", "dirtySections", "step"]`. Integer keys encountered later are indices into it; the decoder keeps a `Map<number,string>` and translates.

### Parse-time errors (each returned as `{ok:false, error}`)

| Condition | Message |
|---|---|
| Invalid outer JSON | `"File is not a valid NovelAI .story file."` |
| Wrong `storyContainerVersion` | `"Unsupported NovelAI format version: got N, expected 1."` |
| msgpack decode throws | `"Could not read the document inside this .story file."` |
| No source=2 segments | `"No AI-generated prose found — did you import before running any AI turns?"` |
| File > 10MB | `"File too large (limit 10MB)."` |
| Upload missing | `"No file uploaded."` |

## API routes

### `POST /api/import/novelai/parse`

`multipart/form-data` with field `file`. Returns:

```ts
type ParseOk = {
  ok: true;
  data: {
    parsed: ParsedStory;
    split: SplitResult;          // chapters + splitSource
    bible: ProposedBible;
    suggestedSlug: string;       // slugified from parsed.title
  };
};
```

Implementation: read buffer, call `decodeNovelAIStory` → `splitProse` → `mapToBible` → slugify. Max file size check (10MB) runs before msgpack to avoid OOM on a pathological upload.

### `POST /api/import/novelai/commit`

JSON body:

```ts
type CommitRequest =
  | { target: "new-story";
      title: string; slug: string; tags: string[];
      chapters: ProposedChapter[];
      bible: ProposedBible;
    }
  | { target: "existing-story";
      slug: string;
      chapters: ProposedChapter[];
    };
```

Response:

```ts
type CommitOk = { ok: true; data: { slug: string; chapterIds: string[] } };
```

**New-story sequence:**

1. Validate slug via [lib/storage/stories.ts](../../../lib/storage/stories.ts); on collision return `{ok:false, error, suggestion:"slug-2"}`. Client resubmits with chosen slug (no silent rename).
2. Create story dir via `storyDir(slug)` from [lib/storage/paths.ts](../../../lib/storage/paths.ts).
3. Write `story.json` (same schema used by existing new-story flow).
4. Write `bible.json` from the committed `ProposedBible`.
5. For each chapter, write `chapters/NNN-<slug>.json` with prose as a single section `{id, content}`. User can split into sections post-import in the editor if desired.
6. Return `{slug, chapterIds}`.

**Existing-story sequence:**

1. Verify story slug exists.
2. Find next chapter number via chapter storage helpers.
3. Write chapters continuing numbering.
4. Return `{slug, chapterIds}`.

**Atomicity:** new-story mode uses a try/catch; if any write fails mid-create, unlink the partially-created story dir before returning the error. Existing-story mode writes chapter-by-chapter; mid-flight failure leaves earlier chapters written (recoverable, acceptable — same semantics as the paste importer).

Both routes use the `ApiResult<T>` envelope from [lib/api.ts](../../../lib/api.ts).

### Privacy

Both new routes are local-only (filesystem I/O; no outbound fetch). Added to the egress allowlist in [tests/privacy/no-external-egress.test.ts](../../../tests/privacy/no-external-egress.test.ts) — non-negotiable per [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) Privacy section. The test stubs `global.fetch` and asserts `recorded === []` after each route exercise.

## UI — NewStoryFromNovelAIDialog

**File:** `components/import/NewStoryFromNovelAIDialog.tsx`

**Flow:**

1. **Pick file** — drop zone + file picker accepting `.story`. POST to `/api/import/novelai/parse`.
2. **Preview & edit** — three columns:
   - **Left (Story metadata):** editable `title`, `slug` (with debounced collision check against `GET /api/stories`), `tags` comma-separated.
   - **Center (Chapter list):** row per detected chapter with editable title, word count, split-source badge (`"////"`, `"Chapter heading"`, `"scene breaks (verify)"`). Expand to edit body in a textarea. Per-row actions: delete (removes from commit), merge-with-next (concatenates bodies).
   - **Right (Proposed Bible):** read-only preview of Premise / People / Places / Notes. Footnote: *"Edit in the Bible editor after import."*
3. **Commit** — "Create story" button POSTs `target: "new-story"`. On success, toast + navigate to `/s/<slug>`.

**Slug collision UX:** inline message like *"'foo' is taken — try 'foo-2'."* with clickable suggestion. Defense-in-depth recheck at commit time.

**Error states:** parse failure shows the server error in a muted panel with a "Choose a different file" button that resets state.

**Visual style:** matches existing [components/publish/ImportChapterDialog.tsx](../../../components/publish/ImportChapterDialog.tsx) — same shadcn primitives, similar three-column grid.

## UI — AddChaptersFromNovelAIDialog

**File:** `components/import/AddChaptersFromNovelAIDialog.tsx`

**Flow:** same parse → preview → commit pattern, trimmed:

1. **Pick file** — POST to `/api/import/novelai/parse`.
2. **Preview & edit** — two columns:
   - **Left (Chapter list):** same as new-story dialog.
   - **Right (EPUB preview):** reuse `renderChapterPreviewHtml` + `EPUB_STYLESHEET` from [lib/publish/epub-preview.ts](../../../lib/publish/epub-preview.ts).
3. **Options row:** checkbox "Generate recap via Grok" (same behavior as paste dialog — fires `/api/generate/recap` per chapter sequentially after commit).
4. **Commit** — "Add N chapter(s)" POSTs `target: "existing-story"` with current slug. Success: toast, close dialog, SWR revalidates chapter list. Stay on the current page.

**Discarded-data affordance:** banner at top of preview: *"Premise, lorebook, and tags from this .story file are ignored in this mode. Use 'New story from NovelAI' on the home page to import everything."*

**Why reuse the paste dialog's preview helper but not the component:** shared *output presentation* via the pure `renderChapterPreviewHtml` function; different *input handling* (file + parsed JSON vs. textarea + cleanup). Sharing the whole component would create conditional mess.

## Edge cases

- Empty NovelAI document → "No AI-generated prose found" error.
- Document with only source=1 segments → same.
- Split produces zero chapters (e.g., lone leading `////`) → fallback to one chapter with the raw prose. Never return 0 chapters.
- Lorebook entry with empty `displayName` and empty `keys` → dropped with debug log.
- Duplicate chapter titles after inference → allowed, user edits if they want.
- Non-UTF-8 bytes in prose → caught as generic decode error.
- Very long single chapter (100k+ words) → no hard cap; Scriptr already handles large chapter files.
- Rapid double-click on commit → button disabled while `saving` (matches `ImportChapterDialog`).
- User closes dialog after parse but before commit → nothing persisted; no cleanup needed.

## Testing strategy

**Unit — `tests/lib/novelai/`:**

- `decode.test.ts` — fixture-driven: happy path, each parse-time error condition.
- `split.test.ts` — table-driven: single `////`, multiple markers, chapter headings (digit + roman), heading vs. `////` priority (marker wins), horizontal-rule fallback, no-split, empty-chapter drop, title inference.
- `map.test.ts` — context → notes, lorebook → people/places partitioning via category, pronoun fallback, location-cue fallback, default fallback.

**API — `tests/api/import-novelai.test.ts`:**

- Parse happy path (multipart upload, preview in response).
- Commit new-story writes files via storage helpers (assert via file read).
- Commit existing-story writes chapters with correct numbering.
- Slug collision returns `{error, suggestion}`.
- Missing file / wrong version / oversize return expected errors.

**Privacy — [tests/privacy/no-external-egress.test.ts](../../../tests/privacy/no-external-egress.test.ts):** add both routes; assert `recorded === []`.

**Component — `tests/components/import/`:**

- `NewStoryFromNovelAIDialog.test.tsx` — mount, drop file, mock parse success, preview renders, commit payload reflects user edits, navigation toast on success. Error-path: mock parse 400 → error banner + reset button.
- `AddChaptersFromNovelAIDialog.test.tsx` — same shape + assert discarded-data note visible, commit payload has `target:"existing-story"` and omits bible/tags.

**E2E — [tests/e2e/](../../../tests/e2e/):** one happy-path Playwright test. Upload fixture on stories page → redirect to new story with chapters present. Uses existing `SCRIPTR_DATA_DIR=/tmp/scriptr-e2e` isolation.

**Fixture:** `lib/novelai/__fixtures__/sample.story` — trimmed version of a real NovelAI export (~5KB). Small prose, 2 lorebook entries, `////` marker included. Neutral placeholder prose so it's safe to commit to the repo.

**Definition of done:** `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run e2e` all pass.
